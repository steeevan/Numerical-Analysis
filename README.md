- **Prerequisite**:  
  A grade of C or better in MAT 2010 and MAT 2250.

## Homework:
- **Assignments**: Weekly homework involving hand-done and MATLAB computer problems will be assigned on Canvas and collected via Gradescope.
- **Policy**: Your lowest score will be dropped.

## Tests and Exams:
- **Tests**: There will be 3 in-class tests consisting of hand-done problems.
- **Final Exam**: The final exam will be in-person, cumulative, and consist of hand-done problems.
- **Grade Replacement**: If your final exam score is higher than your lowest test score, it will replace that test score.
- **Meeting Request**: If the professor has questions regarding your answers on a test or exam, an individual follow-up meeting may be requested.

## Late Policy:
- **Homework**: One 24-hour extension on a single homework is permitted, which must be requested by email before the due date. No other late homework will be accepted.
- **Tests/Final Exam**: No late work accepted.

## Calculators:
- Calculators are permitted, but all work must be shown on homework and tests.

## Grading Scheme:
The higher of the following grading schemes will be used, provided that the final exam is passed:

| Component      | Weight Option 1  | Weight Option 2  |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Homework       | 10%              | 10%              |
| Tests (3 × 18) | 54%              | 36% (2 × 18)     |
| Final Exam     | 36%              | 54%              |

## Email Policy:
- Professor will spend up to 30 minutes each evening answering emails.
- Morning/afternoon emails may not receive a response.
- Complicated questions will be addressed during office hours.

## Attendance:
- Attendance is not explicitly taken but is expected.
- If you miss a class, you are still responsible for the material covered, homework, tests, and exams.

## Course Material Copyright:
All course materials are protected by copyright and may not be shared, uploaded, or distributed.

## Academic Honesty:
- **Collaboration**: High-level discussion on homework is permitted, but test and exam questions must not be discussed with anyone except the professor.
- **Resources**: You may use your lecture notes, homework, and covered textbook sections for assignments. For tests, you may use a one-sided, handwritten 8.5” × 11” sheet of notes.
- **Cheating**: Use of online tools or AI for answers is prohibited. Violations will result in severe penalties, including a possible failing grade and mandatory reporting.
